# Solemas-Creations
### This was a learning project with **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**.
* Even though this was not my first project, it was one of the first projects I did.
* I used my niece's FB candy selling small business as an idea for creating the website.

**Project Notes**
I started with basic HTML5, and the entire site was completed with HTML. This was followed by using CSS for the styling and some animations of the website. JavaScript was used for the remainder of the animations, mainly the animation on the navigation hamburger.
